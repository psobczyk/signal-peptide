	abstract = {When preparing data sets of amino acid or nucleotide sequences it is necessary to exclude redundant or homologous sequences in order to avoid overestimating the predictive performance of an algorithm. For some time methods for doing this have been available in the area of protein structure prediction. We have developed a similar procedure based on pair-wise alignments for sequences with functional sites. We show how a correlation coefficient between sequence similarity and functional homology can be used to compare the efficiency of different similarity measures and choose a nonarbitrary threshold value for excluding redundant sequences. The impact of the choice of scoring matrix used in the alignments is examined. We demonstrate that the parameter determining the quality of the correlation is the relative entropy of the matrix, rather than the assumed ({PAM} or identity) substitution mode. Results are presented for the case of prediction of cleavage sites in signal peptides. By inspection of the false positives, several errors in the database were found. The procedure presented may be used as a general outline for finding a problem-specific similarity measure and threshold value for analysis of other functional amino acid or nucleotide sequence patterns.},

	abstract = {A hidden Markov model of signal peptides has been developed. It contains submodels for the N-terminal part, the hydrophobic region, and the region around the cleavage site. For known signal peptides, the model can be used to assign objective boundaries between these three regions. Applied to our data, the length distributions for the three regions are significantly different from expectations. For instance, the assigned hydrophobic region is between 8 and 12 residues long in almost all eukaryotic signal peptides. This analysis also makes obvious the difference between eukaryotes, Gram-positive bacteria, and Gram-negative bacteria. The model can be used to predict the location of the cleavage site, which it finds correctly in nearly 70\% of signal peptides in a cross-validated test--almost the same accuracy as the best previous method. One of the problems for existing prediction methods is the poor discrimination between signal peptides and uncleaved signal anchors, but this is substantially improved by the hidden Markov model when expanding it with a very simple signal anchor model.},

	abstract = {Several papers have been published where nonlinear machine learning algorithms, e.g. artificial neural networks, support vector machines and decision trees, have been used to model the specificity of the {HIV-1} protease and extract specificity rules. We show that the dataset used in these studies is linearly separable and that it is a misuse of nonlinear classifiers to apply them to this problem. The best solution on this dataset is achieved using a linear classifier like the simple perceptron or the linear support vector machine, and it is straightforward to extract rules from these linear models. We identify key residues in peptides that are efficiently cleaved by the {HIV-1} protease and list the most prominent rules, relating them to experimental results for the {HIV-1} protease.
{MOTIVATION:} Understanding {HIV-1} protease specificity is important when designing {HIV} inhibitors and several different machine learning algorithms have been applied to the problem. However, little progress has been made in understanding the specificity because nonlinear and overly complex models have been used.
{RESULTS:} We show that the problem is much easier than what has previously been reported and that linear classifiers like the simple perceptron or linear support vector machines are at least as good predictors as nonlinear algorithms. We also show how sets of specificity rules can be generated from the resulting linear classifiers.

However, it is still difficult for researchers to choose the best method due to the lack of an effective comparison. For the first time we have made an extensive study on methods for feature extraction, feature transformation and multiclassifier systems ({MCS)} in the problem of {HIV-1} protease. In this work we report an experimental comparison on several learning systems coupled with different feature representations. We confirm previous results stating that linear classifiers obtain higher performance than non-linear classifiers using orthonormal encoding, but we also show that using Karhunen-Loeve transform the performance of neural networks are comparable to one of linear support vector machines. Finally we propose a new hierarchical approach that, for the first time, combines ideas derived from the machine learning methodologies and from a knowledge base of this particular problem. This approach proves to be a successful attempt to obtain a drastically error reduction with respect to the performance of linear classifiers: the error rate decreases from 9.1\% using linear-{SVM} to 6.6\% using our new hierarchical classifier based on some pattern rules.},

	abstract = {An inherent problem in transmembrane protein topology prediction and signal peptide prediction is the high similarity between the hydrophobic regions of a transmembrane helix and that of a signal peptide, leading to cross-reaction between the two types of predictions. To improve predictions further, it is therefore important to make a predictor that aims to discriminate between the two classes. In addition, topology information can be gained when successfully predicting a signal peptide leading a transmembrane protein since it dictates that the N terminus of the mature protein must be on the non-cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Here, we present Phobius, a combined transmembrane protein topology and signal peptide predictor. The predictor is based on a hidden Markov model ({HMM)} that models the different sequence regions of a signal peptide and the different regions of a transmembrane protein in a series of interconnected states. Training was done on a newly assembled and curated dataset. Compared to {TMHMM} and {SignalP}, errors coming from cross-prediction between transmembrane segments and signal peptides were reduced substantially by Phobius. False classifications of signal peptides were reduced from 26.1\% to 3.9\% and false classifications of transmembrane helices were reduced from 19.0\% to 7.7\%. Phobius was applied to the proteomes of Homo sapiens and Escherichia coli. Here we also noted a drastic reduction of false classifications compared to {TMHMM/SignalP}, suggesting that Phobius is well suited for whole-genome annotation of signal peptides and transmembrane regions.

Furthermore, we detected signals corresponding to an alteration of positively and negatively charged residues at a distance of 3-4 amino acids. To look beyond the property codes gained by the methods of physical chemistry, mappings yielding a strong correlation signal are sought for using a Monte Carlo simulation. The mappings leading to strong signals are found to be related to hydrophobicity of alpha-helix propensity. A cluster analysis of the top scoring mappings leads to two novel property codes. These two property codes are gained from sequence data only. They turn out to be similar to known property codes for hydrophobicity or polarity.},

	abstract = {As a first step toward understanding the topology of the signal peptide with respect to the membrane during the protein export process, we have examined the constraints on the length of the cleavage region needed to achieve signal peptidase recognition and cleavage. Using the signal peptide of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase, a series of cleavage region mutants has been constructed. Variations in length were brought about by replacing the wild type cleavage region of the signal peptide with polymers of increasingly more residues. In each case, alanine residues are used exclusively in the -1 and -3 positions to provide only one viable cleavage site. Glutamine residues are used in all other positions in order to vary the length from 3 to 13 total residues. Analysis of these mutants revealed that cleavage regions ranging from 3 to 9 residues are completely and efficiently processed. The extent of processing drops substantially thereafter, with no processing observed for signal peptides with 13-residue long cleavage regions. A second mutant with a 13-residue long cleavage region was designed and analyzed to ensure that the lack of processing reflected a cleavage problem and not a translocation defect. The results are consistent with the notion that the signal peptidase active site is in close proximity to the periplasmic surface of the inner membrane and that interaction of the cleavage region with the signal peptidase probably depends on, and is constrained by, other interactions involving the signal peptide.},

	abstract = {Fast and effective prediction of signal peptides ({SP)} and their cleavage sites is of great importance in computational biology. The approaches developed to predict signal peptide can be roughly divided into machine learning based, and sliding windows based. In order to further increase the prediction accuracy and coverage of organism for {SP} cleavage sites, we propose a novel method for predicting {SP} cleavage sites called Signal-{CTF} that utilizes machine learning and sliding windows, and is designed for N-termial secretory proteins in a large variety of organisms including human, animal, plant, virus, bacteria, fungi and archaea. Signal-{CTF} consists of three distinct elements: (1) a subsite-coupled and regularization function with a scaled window of fixed width that selects a set of candidates of possible secretion-cleavable segment for a query secretory protein; (2) a sum fusion system that integrates the outcomes from aligning the cleavage site template sequence with each of the aforementioned candidates in a scaled window of fixed width to determine the best candidate cleavage sites for the query secretory protein; (3) a voting system that identifies the ultimate signal peptide cleavage site among all possible results derived from using scaled windows of different width. When compared with Signal-{3L} and {SignalP} 4.0 predictors, the prediction accuracy of Signal-{CTF} is 4–12 \%, 10–25 \% higher than that of Signal-{3L} for human, animal and eukaryote, and {SignalP} 4.0 for eukaryota, Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. Comparing with {PRED-SIGNAL} and {SignalP} 4.0 predictors on the 32 archaea secretory proteins of used in Bagos’s paper, the prediction accuracy of Signal-{CTF} is 12.5 \%, 25 \% higher than that of {PRED-SIGNAL} and {SignalP} 4.0, respectively. The predicting results of several long signal peptides show that the Signal-{CTF} can better predict cleavage sites for long signal peptides than {SignalP}, Phobius, Philius, {SPOCTOPUS}, Signal-{CF} and Signal-{3L.} These results show that Signal-{CTF} is more accurate and flexible in predicting signal peptides of different characteristics for many organisms.

	abstract = {Functioning as an "address tag" that directs nascent proteins to their proper cellular and extracellular locations, signal peptides have become a crucial tool in finding new drugs or reprogramming cells for gene therapy. To effectively and timely use such a tool, however, the first important thing is to develop an automated method for rapidly and accurately identifying the signal peptide for a given nascent protein. With the avalanche of new protein sequences generated in the post-genomic era, the challenge has become even more urgent and critical. In this paper, we have developed a novel method for predicting signal peptide sequences and their cleavage sites in human, plant, animal, eukaryotic, Gram-positive, and Gram-negative protein sequences, respectively. The new predictor is called Signal-{3L} that consists of three prediction engines working, respectively, for the following three progressively deepening layers: (1) identifying a query protein as secretory or non-secretory by an ensemble classifier formed by fusing many individual {OET-KNN} (optimized evidence-theoretic K nearest neighbor) classifiers operated in various dimensions of {PseAA} (pseudo amino acid) composition spaces; (2) selecting a set of candidates for the possible signal peptide cleavage sites of a query secretory protein by a subsite-coupled discrimination algorithm; (3) determining the final cleavage site by fusing the global sequence alignment outcome for each of the aforementioned candidates through a voting system. Signal-{3L} is featured by high success prediction rates with short computational time, and hence is particularly useful for the analysis of large-scale datasets.

	abstract = {A hidden Markov model ({HMM)} has been used to describe, predict, identify, and generate secretory signal peptide sequences. The relative strengths of artificial secretory signals emitted from the human signal peptide {HMM} ({SP-HMM)} correlate with their {HMM} bit scores as determined by their effectiveness to direct alkaline phosphatase secretion. The nature of the signal strength is in effect the closeness to the consensus. The {HMM} bit score of 8 is experimentally determined to be the threshold for discriminating signal sequences from non-secretory ones. An artificial {SP-HMM} generated signal sequence of the maximum model bit score ({HMM} + 38) was selected as an ideal human signal sequence. This signal peptide (secrecon) directs strong protein secretion and expression. We further ranked the signal strengths of the signal peptides of the known human secretory proteins by {SP-HMM} bit scores. The applications of high-bit scoring {HMM} signals in recombinant protein production and protein engineering are discussed.},

The method employed is based on a position weight matrix approach improved by a frequency correction which takes in to consideration the amino acid bias present in proteins. The software was trained using sequences extracted from the most recent version of the {SwissProt} database. {PrediSi} is accessible via a web interface. An extra Java package was designed for the integration of {PrediSi} into other software projects. The tool is freely available on the World Wide Web at http://www.predisi.de.},

This is an important problem for scientists to use signal peptides as a vehicle to find new drugs or to reprogram cells for gene therapy (see, e.g. {K.C.} Chou, Current Protein and Peptide Science 2002;3:615-22). In this paper, support vector machines ({SVMs)}, a new machine learning method, is applied to approach this problem. The overall rate of correct prediction for 1939 secretary proteins and 1440 nonsecretary proteins was over 91\%. It has not escaped our attention that the new method may also serve as a useful tool for further investigating many unclear details regarding the molecular mechanism of the {ZIP} code protein-sorting system in cells.},

	abstract = {Spider neurotoxins are commonly used as pharmacological tools and are a popular source of novel compounds with therapeutic and agrochemical potential. Since venom peptides are inherently toxic, the host spider must employ strategies to avoid adverse effects prior to venom use. It is partly for this reason that most spider toxins encode a protective proregion that upon enzymatic cleavage is excised from the mature peptide. In order to identify the mature toxin sequence directly from toxin transcripts, without resorting to protein sequencing, the propeptide cleavage site in the toxin precursor must be predicted bioinformatically. We evaluated different machine learning strategies (support vector machines, hidden Markov model and decision tree) and developed an algorithm ({SpiderP)} for prediction of propeptide cleavage sites in spider toxins. Our strategy uses a support vector machine ({SVM)} framework that combines both local and global sequence information. Our method is superior or comparable to current tools for prediction of propeptide sequences in spider toxins. Evaluation of the {SVM} method on an independent test set of known toxin sequences yielded 96\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity. Furthermore, we sequenced five novel peptides (not used to train the final predictor) from the venom of the Australian tarantula Selenotypus plumipes to test the accuracy of the predictor and found 80\% sensitivity and 99.6\% 8-mer specificity. Finally, we used the predictor together with homology information to predict and characterize seven groups of novel toxins from the deeply sequenced venom gland transcriptome of S. plumipes, which revealed structural complexity and innovations in the evolution of the toxins. The precursor prediction tool ({SpiderP)} is freely available on {ArachnoServer} ({http://www.arachnoserver.org/spiderP.html)}, a web portal to a comprehensive relational database of spider toxins. All training data, test data, and scripts used are available from the {SpiderP} website.},

	abstract = {Intramembrane proteolysis is now firmly established as a prominent biological process, and structure elucidation is emerging as the new frontier in the understanding of these novel membrane-embedded enzymes. Reproducing this unusual hydrolysis within otherwise water-excluding transmembrane regions with purified proteins is a challenging prerequisite for such structural studies. Here we show the bacterial expression, purification, and reconstitution of proteolytically active signal peptide peptidase ({SPP)}, a membrane-embedded enzyme in the presenilin family of aspartyl proteases. This finding formally proves that, unlike presenilin, {SPP} does not require any additional proteins for proteolysis. Surprisingly, the conserved C-terminal half of {SPP} is sufficient for proteolytic activity; purification and reconstitution of this engineered fragment of several {SPP} orthologues revealed that this region defines a functional domain for an intramembrane aspartyl protease. The discovery of minimal requirements for intramembrane proteolysis should facilitate mechanistic and structural analysis and help define general biochemical principles of hydrolysis in a hydrophobic environment.},
