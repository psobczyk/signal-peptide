	abstract = {When preparing data sets of amino acid or nucleotide sequences it is necessary to exclude redundant or homologous sequences in order to avoid overestimating the predictive performance of an algorithm. For some time methods for doing this have been available in the area of protein structure prediction. We have developed a similar procedure based on pair-wise alignments for sequences with functional sites. We show how a correlation coefficient between sequence similarity and functional homology can be used to compare the efficiency of different similarity measures and choose a nonarbitrary threshold value for excluding redundant sequences. The impact of the choice of scoring matrix used in the alignments is examined. We demonstrate that the parameter determining the quality of the correlation is the relative entropy of the matrix, rather than the assumed ({PAM} or identity) substitution mode. Results are presented for the case of prediction of cleavage sites in signal peptides. By inspection of the false positives, several errors in the database were found. The procedure presented may be used as a general outline for finding a problem-specific similarity measure and threshold value for analysis of other functional amino acid or nucleotide sequence patterns.},

	abstract = {A hidden Markov model of signal peptides has been developed. It contains submodels for the N-terminal part, the hydrophobic region, and the region around the cleavage site. For known signal peptides, the model can be used to assign objective boundaries between these three regions. Applied to our data, the length distributions for the three regions are significantly different from expectations. For instance, the assigned hydrophobic region is between 8 and 12 residues long in almost all eukaryotic signal peptides. This analysis also makes obvious the difference between eukaryotes, Gram-positive bacteria, and Gram-negative bacteria. The model can be used to predict the location of the cleavage site, which it finds correctly in nearly 70\% of signal peptides in a cross-validated test--almost the same accuracy as the best previous method. One of the problems for existing prediction methods is the poor discrimination between signal peptides and uncleaved signal anchors, but this is substantially improved by the hidden Markov model when expanding it with a very simple signal anchor model.},

	abstract = {Several papers have been published where nonlinear machine learning algorithms, e.g. artificial neural networks, support vector machines and decision trees, have been used to model the specificity of the {HIV-1} protease and extract specificity rules. We show that the dataset used in these studies is linearly separable and that it is a misuse of nonlinear classifiers to apply them to this problem. The best solution on this dataset is achieved using a linear classifier like the simple perceptron or the linear support vector machine, and it is straightforward to extract rules from these linear models. We identify key residues in peptides that are efficiently cleaved by the {HIV-1} protease and list the most prominent rules, relating them to experimental results for the {HIV-1} protease.
{MOTIVATION:} Understanding {HIV-1} protease specificity is important when designing {HIV} inhibitors and several different machine learning algorithms have been applied to the problem. However, little progress has been made in understanding the specificity because nonlinear and overly complex models have been used.
{RESULTS:} We show that the problem is much easier than what has previously been reported and that linear classifiers like the simple perceptron or linear support vector machines are at least as good predictors as nonlinear algorithms. We also show how sets of specificity rules can be generated from the resulting linear classifiers.

	abstract = {Recently, several works have approached the {HIV-1} protease specificity problem by applying a number of classifier creation and combination methods, known as ensemble methods, from the field of machine learning. However, it is still difficult for researchers to choose the best method due to the lack of an effective comparison. For the first time we have made an extensive study on methods for feature extraction, feature transformation and multiclassifier systems ({MCS)} in the problem of {HIV-1} protease. In this work we report an experimental comparison on several learning systems coupled with different feature representations. We confirm previous results stating that linear classifiers obtain higher performance than non-linear classifiers using orthonormal encoding, but we also show that using Karhunen-Loeve transform the performance of neural networks are comparable to one of linear support vector machines. Finally we propose a new hierarchical approach that, for the first time, combines ideas derived from the machine learning methodologies and from a knowledge base of this particular problem. This approach proves to be a successful attempt to obtain a drastically error reduction with respect to the performance of linear classifiers: the error rate decreases from 9.1\% using linear-{SVM} to 6.6\% using our new hierarchical classifier based on some pattern rules.},

Orthologues of {SPP} and {SPPLs} have been identified in other vertebrates, plants, and eukaryotes. In line with their diverse subcellular localisations ranging from the {ER} ({SPP}, {SPPL2c)}, the Golgi ({SPPL3)}, the plasma membrane ({SPPL2b)} to lysosomes/late endosomes ({SPPL2a)}, the different members of the {SPP/SPPL} family seem to exhibit distinct functions. Here, we review the substrates of these proteases identified to date as well as the current state of knowledge about the physiological implications of these proteolytic events as deduced from in vivo studies. Furthermore, the present knowledge on the structure of intramembrane proteases of the {SPP/SPPL} family, their cleavage mechanism and their substrate requirements are summarised.

Growing evidence indicates that signal sequences contain information that specifies the choice of targeting pathway, the efficiency of translocation, the timing of cleavage and even postcleavage functions. As a consequence, signal sequences can have important roles in modulating protein biogenesis. Based on a synthesis of studies in numerous experimental systems, we propose that substrate-specific sequence elements embedded in a conserved domain structure impart unique and physiologically important functionality to signal sequences.},

We found hydrophobicity autocorrelation functions to be strongly oscillating. Another strong signal is the monotonously decaying alpha-helix propensity autocorrelation function. Furthermore, we detected signals corresponding to an alteration of positively and negatively charged residues at a distance of 3-4 amino acids. To look beyond the property codes gained by the methods of physical chemistry, mappings yielding a strong correlation signal are sought for using a Monte Carlo simulation. The mappings leading to strong signals are found to be related to hydrophobicity of alpha-helix propensity. A cluster analysis of the top scoring mappings leads to two novel property codes. These two property codes are gained from sequence data only. They turn out to be similar to known property codes for hydrophobicity or polarity.},

	abstract = {As a first step toward understanding the topology of the signal peptide with respect to the membrane during the protein export process, we have examined the constraints on the length of the cleavage region needed to achieve signal peptidase recognition and cleavage. Using the signal peptide of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase, a series of cleavage region mutants has been constructed. Variations in length were brought about by replacing the wild type cleavage region of the signal peptide with polymers of increasingly more residues. In each case, alanine residues are used exclusively in the -1 and -3 positions to provide only one viable cleavage site. Glutamine residues are used in all other positions in order to vary the length from 3 to 13 total residues. Analysis of these mutants revealed that cleavage regions ranging from 3 to 9 residues are completely and efficiently processed. The extent of processing drops substantially thereafter, with no processing observed for signal peptides with 13-residue long cleavage regions. A second mutant with a 13-residue long cleavage region was designed and analyzed to ensure that the lack of processing reflected a cleavage problem and not a translocation defect. The results are consistent with the notion that the signal peptidase active site is in close proximity to the periplasmic surface of the inner membrane and that interaction of the cleavage region with the signal peptidase probably depends on, and is constrained by, other interactions involving the signal peptide.},
